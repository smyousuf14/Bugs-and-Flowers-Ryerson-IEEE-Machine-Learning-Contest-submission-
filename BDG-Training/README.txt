This contains the user instructions in order to run the file.

Before the instructions for running the program, it is important to note that in this folder contains:

"test.py" which is the source code
"test.exe" which is the executable file
"Bugs and Flowers detection" is a pdf file which contains the short report.


---------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

1. Run the executable file untitled "test.exe"
2. Once the program starts the run it will prompt you to enter the name of the input file. The input file is the
file that will be sent as an input, the file that we where we want to detect bugs and flowers.

NOTE: If you want to detect a different image, take any .jpg image and copy and paste it into the "images" folder.
By different, I mean different than the ones that I already placed in the "images" folder.

3. Press enter and in a few seconds, depending upon your PC, an image will pop up with the labeled bounded boxes,
accuracy, as well as the statement describing the image(if there is a bug and/or flower or not)
4. DONE!
